# React and .NET

Experimenting creating applications using .NET Core and writing a separate SPA (Single Page Application) in React that chats to the backend .NET core application.

I used Visual Studio Community's React template which came with some examples of how to link a C# Controller to the front end React code and I experimented with a very simple 'Hello World' and 'Day Today' application which display the 'Hello World' text and the date and time today.

I also tried publishing to Azure for the first time and you can see the application up and running <a href="https://testingreactdotnet.azurewebsites.net/">here</a>.
